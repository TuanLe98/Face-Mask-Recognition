# Ideas:
Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task cumbersome and challenging.
# TechStack/framework used:
* OpenCV
* Caffe-based face detector
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
# Dataset
This dataset consists of 20095 images belonging to two classes:

with_mask: 1105 images
without_mask: 8995 images
The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:
